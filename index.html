					<p>I am the LSST Discovery Alliance <a href="https://lsstdiscoveryalliance.org/programs/data-science-fellowship/">Data Science Fellowship Program</a> Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics, Northwestern University. In November 2024, I will deliver the Hunstead lecture series at the Sydney Institute of Astronomy, University of Sydney, on data science education and astrophysics. I am also a first generation college graduate.</p>
					
					<p>My PhD in Physics was completed at the <a href="https://www.physics.ucr.edu">University of California, Riverside</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://sbird.github.io">Simeon Bird</a>. My dissertation was on measurements of fundamental physics and galaxy evolution from the largest scale structures in the universe. I am broadly interested in machine learning and statistics with applications to large astrophysical and cosmological surveys, especially the <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org">Vera C Rubin Observatory</a> Legacy Survey of Space & Time, The Subaru Telescope <a href="https://pfs.ipmu.jp">Prime Focus Spectrograph</a> Galaxy Evolution Survey, and to the design of future <a href="https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/graphic_history/intensitymapping.html">Line Intensity Mapping</a> experiments at many wavelengths. These projects will revolutionize our understanding of fundamental physics, including the nature of dark matter and dark energy, improve our theories of gravity on the largest scales, and reveal the connections between galaxies and the structure of the universe.</p>
					
					<p> I also have extensive experience in science education and social justice. I hold certificates in higher education pedagogy, inclusive excellence, and science policy from the University of California, Riverside, and a certificate in Reflective & Effective Teaching from the Searle Center for Advancing Teaching and Learning at Northwestern University. I led the <a href="https://www.aps.org/initiatives/inclusion/idea">APS IDEA</a> team at UCR and co-lead the Chicago Area LSST Expansion Partnership between Northwestern, Illinois Tech, and the Chicago City Colleges to expand access for transfer and non-traditional students to astrophysical survey science. My teaching and mentorship projects are funded by the National Science Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Brinson Foundation, and the Heising-Simons Foundation.</p>

			  <p>The Prime Focus Spectrograph is an instrument at the Subaru Telescope at the summit of Mauna a WƒÅkea ("Mauna Kea"). This location has significant cultural, historical, and natural significance in 	Hawai'i. A significant number of people remain unhoused after the 2023 fires on the island of Maui, you can donate to support this community <a href="https://www.hawaiicommunityfoundation.org/strengthening/maui-strong-fund"> here</a> or to support the Native Hawaiian community more broadly <a href="https://www.hawaiiancouncil.org"> here. </a>
  </p>
	 <p> The Northwestern campus sits on the traditional homelands of the people of the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa as well as the Menominee, Miami and Ho-Chunk nations. It was also a site of trade, travel, gathering and healing for more than a dozen other Native tribes and is still home to over 100,000 tribal members in the state of Illinois.</p>
